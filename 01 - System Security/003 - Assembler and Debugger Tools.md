Assembler:

A assembler is  a program that translates the assembly language into the machine code. There are several different assemblers based on the target system.

Few of them are:
1. Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM): x86 assembler uses intel syntax for MS DOS and Microsoft Windows
2. GNU Assembler (GAS): used by GNU Project, default back-end of GCC. 
3. Netwide Assembler (NASM): x86 used to write 16,32,64 bit programs. One of the most popular assembler for Linux
4. Flat Assembler (FASM): x86, supports intel-style.

Once source code file is assembled the resulting file is called as object file. Executable file is created with the help of Linker which takes one or more object file and combine them to create the executable file.

**Compiler:**
Compiler is same as Assembler which converts the source code into low-level code or directly into the executable.
